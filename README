Dave's Git Toolkit
------------------

This is a loose collection of random tools that I have built to make
working with git a little bit easier.  Unless otherwise noted in the
files themselves, all these tools are released under the MIT license, so
you can pretty much do whatever you want with them.

At least one of these tools also expects to have some version of
git-svn-clone-externals in your path (as of today I'm using the version
with an md5sum of d0ee42c21f810d1259a5622abee21844).  You should be able
to grab a copy from github at:
